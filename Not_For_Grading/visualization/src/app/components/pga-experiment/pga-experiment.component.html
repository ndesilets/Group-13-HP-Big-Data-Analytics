    <h3>Program Global Area Experiment:</h3>

    <hr>

    <p>	
		The PGA is a memory region that contains data and control information for a server process. It is non-shared memory created by Oracle Database when a server process is
		started. Access to the PGA is exclusive to the server process, there is one PGA for each server process. The overall memory allocated to each PGA is referred to as
		the total instance PGA memory, while the collection of each instance PGA is referred to as the instance PGA. The memory threshold for this structure is set by a system
		parameter. Each PGA contains a session memory and private SQL area. 		
		<br/><br/>
		Our experiment attempted to look into what system parameters we could alter to provide more memory allocation to parallel processes, thus relieving the need to go to disk for memory
		intensive operations like sorts, hashes and merges. By relieving this performance bottle neck, we hoped to increase query speeds. This was the first experiment our team set up.

	<h4>Parameters:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>PGA_AGGREGATE_LIMIT: Upper bound threshold for memory alloted to instance parallel processes</li>
		<li>PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET: Target values for PGA, below threshold, that the system considers safe</li>
		<li>WORK_AREA_SIZE_POLICY: When set to auto, uses PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET, else uses WORK_AREA_SIZE parameter values</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Undocumented Parameters:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>_PGA_MAX_SIZE: System defined memory size alloted to each work area (ie. sort, hash, merge)</li>
		<li>_SMM_MAX_SIZE: System defined parameter for serial processing work areas</li>
		<li>_SMM_PX_MAX_SIZE: System defined parameter for parallel processing work areas</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Views:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>V$PGASTAT: Provides PGA memory usage statistics</li>
		<li>V$PROCESS: Contains information about the currently active processes within the instance</li>
		<li>V$SQL_WORKAREA: Displays information about work areas used by SQL cursors</li>
		<li>V$SQL_WORKAREA_ACTIVE: Contains an instantaneous view of work areas currently allocated by the system</li>		
	</ul>

    <h3>In-Memory Column Store</h3>

    <hr>

    <p>	
		This is a feature new to Oracle 12c, the IMCS stored data in columnar format rather than traditional row format. The objects which can be flagged for storage within this memory structure include:
		tables, columns, partitions, and indexes. This means that the specificity of object selection has very high granularity, allowing for optimal flexability. Columns of data have header blocks which
		contain pre-aggregated values (ie. min and max)of data within each compression unit, allowing for selective access to columns based on their content values. This is especially useful when performing
		analytic queries that rely on a where clause to filter results, only the columns of interest need to be accessed, thus relieving some run time overhead.
		<br/><br/>
		Additional benefits from this feature include six levels of block compression:
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>NO MEMCOMPRESS: Data populated without any compression</li>
			<li>FOR DML: Minimal compression, optimized for DML performance</li>
			<li>FOR QUERY LOW: Optimized for query performance (default)</li>
			<li>FOR QUERY HIGH: Optimized for query performance as well as space saving </li>
			<li>FOR CAPACITY LOW: Balanced with a greater bias towards space saving</li>
			<li>FOR CAPACITY HIGH: Optimized for space saving</li>
		</ul>
	<br/>
	<!-- Potentially mention something about how compressed blocks can be accessed without decompression -->
	<h4>Parameters:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>INMEMORY_SIZE: Initialization parameter for allocating memory resources to the IMCS</li>
		<li>PARALLEL_DEGREE_POLICY: This parameter must be set to Auto or Adaptive to enable In-Memory</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Views:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>V$IM_SEGMENTS: Details information aboubt all the in-memory segments within the database</li>
		<li>V$INMEMORY_AREA: Contains information on the space allocated inside the In-Memory area</li>

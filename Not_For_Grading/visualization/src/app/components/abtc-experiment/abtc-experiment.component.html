    <h3>Automatic Big Table Cache</h3>

    <hr>

    <p>	
		This is a feature new to Oracle 12c, the ABTC is allocated a portion of the memory previously assigned to the buffer cache. ABTC is designed to integrate queries with the
		the buffer cache to enhance the In-Memory query capabilites of an Oracle Database. ABTC uses temperature and object based algorithms to track medium and big tables, objects
		above a specificed threshold parameter. While the ABTC is promarily desinged to enhance performance for data warehouse workloads, it can alse be used to improve mix workloads.
		This feature can be used to increase parallel query performance by caching large objects such as tables, indexes and partitions. The benefits in parallel processing are mainly
		seen from removing the need for parallel slaves to perform direct reads from disk and rather have them access the blocks from cached memeory.

    <h3>Temporary Tablespace Ramdisk</h3>

    <hr>

    <p>	
		Temporary tablespaces contain transient data that persists only for the duration of the session. This memory structure is what is used when a memory intensive operation
		such as a sort, hash, or merge is executed and available PGA work area for those processes is depleted. The operation must then tranfer the blocks to temporary tablespace
		where the operation can be completed. The IO overhead for this process is what our clients were experiencing as long run times for nightly queries.
		<br/><br/>
		By implementing a tmpfs unix temporary filesystem that resides in memory and pointing the parameter defined temporary tablespace to this partition, we were able to observe
		the same performance increases that we saw in the PGA experiment. This was not necessarily the solution that our clients were interested in, so it was not investigated further.

This directory contains code that was written to develop the test automation suite and web based user interface for diagnostics (no longer used).

Backup/

Contains an archive of old or miscellaneous code. The web based user interface for our toolkit is contained within this directory.


Index_Experiment/

Contains an extra set of experiments involving indexing and partitioning in Oracle database. These are supplemental experiments designed after our clients gave their HOTSOS presentation (the critical point of our project) and are considered stretch goals.

Misc_Scripts/

Contains a set of misc. SQL and BASH scripts that were not critical in the scope of our project.

Test_Automation/

Contains the toolkit that we created to automate experimenting with different parameters and features within Oracle database and collecting data. Please note that the test scripts within were primarily designed to run on our client's development server and will require Oracle database to be installed along with the necessary schema required for the tests. Additionally, many of these tests often take several hours to run.

## Include info to allow program execution.

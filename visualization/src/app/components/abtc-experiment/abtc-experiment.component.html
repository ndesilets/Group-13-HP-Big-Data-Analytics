    <h3>Automatic Big Table Cache</h3>

    <hr>

    <p>
        Can be used to increase parallel query performance by caching large table data and other objects (indexes, partitions) in memory. Complements the traditional block buffer cache by adding in the capability of caching entire tables and other objects in memory. By doing so, this lets parallel slaves avoid having to perform direct reads and instead pull data cached in memory.

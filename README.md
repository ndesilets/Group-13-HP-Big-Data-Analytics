<h1>HP Big Data Analytics: Effects of Memory Management and Parallelism on Query Performance</h1>

<h2>Group Thirteen</h2>

This repository will act as the version control system that our team will use to document changes made in our class documentation
throughout the next three terms. The development process of our toolkit will be trackable back to the initialization of the file,
we will also use the GitHub Wiki feature to keep a blog of our progress.

Any TeX files will have both the source code (.tex) and a copy of the pdf for ease of access.
